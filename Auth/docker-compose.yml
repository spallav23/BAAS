# NOTE: This file is kept for reference but infrastructure is centralized
# Use the root docker-compose.yml instead: ../docker-compose.yml
# All services share MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, and Zookeeper from the root directory

# To start infrastructure, run from the root directory:
# docker-compose up -d

# This file is deprecated - use ../docker-compose.yml for infrastructure
